This folder contains:

1. dfc.c - This file acts as Client Program
2. dfs.c - This file acts as Server Program
3. Makefile   - This file creates two executable file client and server 
4. dfc.conf - Configuration file for client1 [Alice]
5. dfc2.conf - Configuration file for client2 [Bob]
6. dfs.conf - Configuration file for server

Start the Server

1. Open Terminal. 
2. Navigate to the curent directory

Run the command: ./dfs [directory] [portnum]
 - example: ./dfs DFS2/ 10002


The server runs forever, using TCP Protocol.


Start the Client

1. Open Terminal. 
2. Navigate to the curent directory

Run the command: ./dfs [Configfile] 

/******************************************************************************/
The client supports the following functions:

Available commands:
1. gets:
	Enter the filename and subfolder when prompted [NOTE: For empty subfolder enter /]
	1. Gets the file parts from distributed servers
	Returns: ERROR message if files doesn't exist
 - example: get/Get foo1 xyz/ ##gets the file foo1 from the subdirectory xyz/
	

2. puts:
	Enter the filename and subfolder when prompted
	1. puts files onto distributed servers with redundancy
 - example: put/PUT foo1 xyz/  ##puts the file foo1 in the subdirectory xyz/

3. ls:
	This command lists all the available files on the server.
 - example: list xyz/  ##lists the files in the subdirectory xyz/


Supports timeout of 1 second
Extra Credits:
	Optimized get 
	Encryption/Decryption done using XOR
	Implemented subfolder on DFS
